Monte Carlo simulation of the EPL title race using real fixtures and goal models.

# EPL Title Race – Monte Carlo Simulation

This notebook simulates the remainder of an EPL season using a simple
Monte Carlo approach based on real fixtures and historical results.

## What this is
- A learning exercise in reasoning under uncertainty
- Uses goal distributions (Poisson) and actual remaining fixtures
- Simulates the rest of the season many times to estimate outcomes

## What this is NOT
- A prediction model
- A betting tool
- A fully calibrated forecasting system

## Key idea
Over a season, teams that consistently avoid bad days tend to outperform
teams that rely on occasional big wins.

## Notes
- Built in Google Colab
- Data sourced from publicly available football results
- Shared for learning and discussion
